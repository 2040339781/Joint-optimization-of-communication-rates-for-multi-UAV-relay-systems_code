File Description: This is a simulation code based on MATLAB for multi UAV relay auxiliary communication system. The document not only includes all the original algorithm implementations of the paper, but also includes the comparison algorithms of different schemes.
Algorithm used: convex optimization (based on convex difference and introducing auxiliary variables).
Usage: CVX toolbox and MOSEK solver should be installed before use. Open it directly with MATLAB and you can eat it!!
